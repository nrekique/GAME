BSPUTIL(1)                                                          BSPUTIL(1)



NAME
       bsputil - utiltiy for working with Quake BSP files


SYNOPSIS
       bsputil [OPTION]... BSPFILE


DESCRIPTION
       bsputil is a small utility for basic manipulation of Quake BSP files.


OPTIONS
       --extract-textures
              Extract  the  texture  data  from BSPFILE and create a Quake WAD
              file.  The output filename is generated from BSPFILE  by  strip-
              ping the .bsp extension and adding the .wad extension.

       --extract-entities
              Extract  the  entity  data  from BSPFILE and create a plain text
              .ent file.  The output filename is  generated  from  BSPFILE  by
              stripping the .bsp extension and adding the .ent extension.

       --check
              Load  BSPFILE  into  memory and run a set of tests to check that
              all internal data structures are self-consistent.  Currently the
              tests  are very basic and not all warnings will result in errors
              from all versions of the Quake engine.  This option is not  tar-
              geted  at level designers, but is intended to assist with devel-
              opment of the qbsp tool and check that a  "clean"  bsp  file  is
              generated.
