BSPINFO(1)                                                          BSPINFO(1)



NAME
       bspinfo - print basic information about a Quake BSP file


SYNOPSIS
       bspinfo BSPFILE


DESCRIPTION
       bspinfo  will  print  a very basic summary of the internal data in BSP-
       FILE.  The BSP version number is printed, followed by one line for each
       of  the  data  types inside, giving the count and data size in bytes of
       each data type.

       If the filename BSPFILE does not have a .bsp  extension,  bsputil  will
       look  for  a .bsp file by stripping the file extension from BSPFILE (if
       any) and appending ".bsp".
